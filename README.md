# Hello!

This is a repository for my Neovim configuration. It uses:

* The MOLOKAI colorscheme
* Packer.nvim for plugins
* Nvim-Tree for file exploration, with ```fil``` mapped to ```:NvimTreeToggle```
* ToggleTerm for terminal, with ```ter``` mapped to ```:ToggleTerm```
* Telescope for fuzzy search
